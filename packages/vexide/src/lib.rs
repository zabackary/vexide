//! # vexide
//!
//! Open-source Rust runtime for VEX V5 robots. vexide provides a `no_std` Rust runtime,
//! async executor, device API, and more for the VEX V5 brain!
//!
//! vexide is the successor to [pros-rs](https://github.com/vexide/pros-rs) which are a set of unmaintained API using bindings over [PROS](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros).
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! If you're just getting started, we recommend going through our [docs](https://vexide.dev/docs/), which provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a development environment
//! with [vexide-template](https://github.com/vexide/vexide-template).
//!
//! ## Project Structure
//!
//! The vexide runtime is split into 7 subcrates. The one you're looking at right now re-exports
//! each of these crates into a single package. You can view the respective docs for each of them below:
//!
//! - [`vexide-core`](https://docs.rs/vexide_core) provides lowlevel core functionality for programs, such as allocators, synchronization primitives, serial printing, I/O and timers.
//! - [`vexide-devices`](https://docs.rs/vexide_devices) contains all device-related bindings for things like motors and sensors.
//! - [`vexide-async`](https://docs.rs/vexide_async) implements our cooperative async runtime as well as several important async futures.
//! - [`vexide-graphics`](https://docs.rs/vexide_graphics) implements graphics drivers for some popular embedded Rust graphics libraries like [Slint] and [`embedded-graphics`].
//! - [`vexide-macro`](https://docs.rs/vexide_macro) contains the source code for the `#[vexide::main]` proc-macro.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In order to get a program running, use the `#[vexide::main]` attribute on your main function.
//! ```rust
//! use vexide::prelude::*;
//! #[vexide::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     println!("Hello, world!");
//! }
//!```
//!
//! Check out our [docs](https://vexide.dev/docs/) for more in-depth usage guides.
